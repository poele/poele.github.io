		  		&#9654; They say I'm a storyteller. Honestly, I've always thought 
		  		<br>&#9654; of myself as "they". When I was younger, I decided that
		  		<br>&#9654; I was going to change the world. Through entertaining it.
		  		<br>
		  		<br>&#9654; I wanted to make a video-game that would change the world.

		  		<br><br><br>&#9654; Kids think up a lot of weird shit, man.
		  		<br>&#9654; I decided a little later I was going to be a super hacker.
		  		<br>&#9654; As you can tell, that didn't happen either.
		  		<br>
		  		<br>
		  		<br><br>&#9654; Now you can be a hacker at 60FPS, no coding required.
		  		<br><br>&#9654; I guess what I'm trying to say is...
		  		<br>&#9654; As excited as I think I am, I'm actually pretty boring.
		  		<br>&#9654; I too laid awake at night, staring at the ceiling, thinking
		  		<br><br>&#9654; "What the hell am I going to do with my life?"
		  		<br>
		  		<br>
		  		<br><br>&#9654; Can't say I've found the answer yet. 
		  		<br><br>&#9654; But I do know I've come a lot closer.
		  		<br><br><br><br>&#9654; Enough about my childhood. Let's talk shop.
		  		<br>&#9654; Before here, I wasn't looking forward to the future.
		  		<br>&#9654; I was slowly dying of boredom in a marketing internship.
		  		<br>&#9654; The best thing that could've happened to me was getting accidentally fired.

		  		<br><br>&#9654; Seriously, it was accidental.
		  		<br>&#9654; Not that I made a great 'office fun manager'.

		  		<br><br><br><br>&#9654; But just before I left, my ex-boss recommended GA.
		  		<br>&#9654; So there's my origins story.

		  		<br><br><br>&#9654; Anyway, I don't have a spirit animal. I'm a fucking dragon.
